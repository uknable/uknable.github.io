         <p>In his book ‘A Beginner’s Guide to Constructing the Universe’, Michael S. Schneider writes that the peoples of ancient civilisations learned about 
the spiritual quality of numbers and served as a moral guideline. This is far different to the mathematics taught in modern times where we are taught 
numbers to merely manipulate quantities. Back in ancient times, mathematics was taught in tandem with philosophy as it was believed that numbers and 
geometry held lessons about the nature of the universe. For example, the number one was symbolised by a circle with a dot in the middle and was 
considered to be the precursor to all subsequent numbers and their symbolic representations of which the universe was constructed (Schneider, 1995)[1].
<br><br>
The Self as described by psychologist Carl Jung is also represented by a circle with a dot in the middle. The dot represents the ego which is the 
subject of an individual’s consciousness while the outer circle reflects the Self which is the subject of the individual’s whole totality that 
includes the unconscious as well as the consciousness(Jung, Adler & Hull, 2014)[2]. Jungian psychology also defines the term individuation as the 
“development of the psychological individual as a differentiated being from the general, collective psychology”(Jung, Adler & Hull, 2014)[3]. 
<br><br>
I wanted to use this as the basis of this assignment creating a jigsaw puzzle of a circle and the journey toward it’s solution to represent the 
process of individuation but I decided that circles looked a bit boring so I drew inspiration from my lifelong fixation of flowers to make it look 
more interesting.<br><br>
