                    The goal of this project was to design and develop an online learning module for second-year medical
                    students to supplement their classes on the topic of congenital heart disease in babies.

                <p>
                    Traditional teaching of anatomy and pathology includes practical sessions with cadaveric
                    samples, however, these samples degrade overtime and become less available due to improvements in
                    screening and surgery.
                </p>
                <p><b>Heart samples degrade overtime</b> and are less available due to improvements in screening and
                    surgery
                    yet the increasing number of students each year increases their demand.</p>
                <p><b>Students in rural areas</b> do not have access to the samples.</p>
                <p><b>Students are left to explore the samples independently </b>after watching an old video about heart
                    formation.</p>

                <p><b>Second year medical students</b> learning about congenital heart deformities in
                    babies. Students in the classroom will be using an iPad to access the module that should take about
                    30 minutes to complete.</p>
                <p><b>Experienced doctors</b> who may be older and might not have much coding
                    experience.</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Process</h1>

                <p>The client provided a document containing the content of the module which used to create the
                    wireflow. The module consists of four cases with each case divided into three sections: case
                    details, exploration and explanation.</p>

                    <img src="img/hearts/hearts_wireflow.png" alt="Wireflow">
                </figure>

                <p>We then did rough sketches to see what the screens could look like.</p>

                    <img src="img\hearts\hearts-wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes">
                </figure>

                <p>Prototyped on Figma to test the pacing and the positioning of the different elements.</p>

                    <img src="img\hearts\hearts-figma.png" alt="Prototyped on Figma">
                </figure>

                <p>
                    We received feedback saying that the case number next to the names (e.g. Case number #17040, Ben’s
                    Story) should be removed, leaving only the name to make the journey feel more personable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The visual design took on a very friendly aesthetic when moving into the high-fidelity wireframes.
                    We also decided to design for landscape orientation since the students will be using iPads. I won't
                    elaborate on the visual design as it was not my role in this project.

                    <p>
                        An interactive, virtual representation of the heart addresses the problem of accessibility,
                        making the sample available even for students unable to attend the practical sessions in person.

                    <p>
                        The camera orientates itself to show students how to look at the heart according to the current
                        instruction. This provides direct guidance to students, a lack of which was identified as a
                        problem of how the module was conducted previously.

                    <p>
                        Structure and guidance is also provided by labels pointing to the relevant features of the
                        heart. These disappear when features are out of view and can be toggled on and off by the
                        student.

                <p>
                    After completing the project, our team was invited to present our design to the Sydney Medical
                    School MD2020 Education Showcase where it was very well received. The application was then handed
                    off to Westmead Clinical School.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When reflecting back on my experience working on this project, I definitely felt confused in the
                    beginning. I didn’t even know what questions to ask to clarify our goal. It became a lot clearer
                    when our client provided the structure of the module because it was clear to them what they wanted
                    from us. From there the project was very straightforward and fun to work on. In the future, I would
                    ask the client what they have in mind for the project, if they have any content to provide us and
                    what they expect us to do for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can take a look at the module <a href="http://cardiac-cases.herokuapp.com/">here.</a> It may
                    take a while to load up at first.
