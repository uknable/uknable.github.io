            <h1 id="part1">Introduction</h1>
            <p>Increasing global temperatures, melting ice caps, bleaching corals, volatile weather conditions, degrading ecosystems. These are all consequences of mass consumption and the waste it produces. Since the problem is very large and consists of many elements, this research report will focus only on one of them: household recycling. </p>

            <h2 id="part1-1">Problem Area</h2>
            <p>According to the Australian Plastics Recycling Survey assessing the 2016–17 financial year, over 3.5 million tonnes of plastics were consumed with only under 300,000 of those being recycled. That’s under 10%.
               </p><p>
            The 2018 National Waste Report prepared for the Department of the Environment and Energy of Australia found that non-hazardous food waste from households and businesses amounted to 4.3 million tonnes with only 11% being recycled.
            This report also shows that 60% of the 5.6 million tonnes of paper and cardboard waste was recycled with the other 40% sent to landfill. </p>

            <h2 id="part1-2">Problem Scenario</h2>

            <p>The situation where people are not recycling an item that could’ve been recycled is the problem scenario we’ve decided to focus on.
               </p><p>
            Many people are in favour of recycling but are confused as to how. Each local council has different specifications for how to properly recycle.
            </p><p> 
            If we are to continue to exist on this planet then we’ll need to change the way we deal with our waste. Recycling is one of the ways we can reduce the production of new materials that that end up damaging the environment.
            </p>

            <h1 id="part2">Research</h1>
            <h3 id="part2-1-1">Online Ethnography</h3>
            <p>Online ethnograhy was chosen because it provides extremely rich data for the little amount of setup required to conduct it. The topic of recycling is not a common area of discussion. This makes online ethnography a great choice since we can search through the history of the forums to dig up past threads for data.</p>
            <h4>The Online Platforms</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Reddit</li>
               <li>Whirlpool</li>
               <li>OzBargain</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Criteria For Picking Out Threads</h4>
            <p>The threads were chosen from a list sorted for relevance after searching for the word “recycle”.
            The thread had to be a discussion of what could be recycled or advice on how to recycle something in the context of the household.
            Attitudes and opinions about recycling were avoided as that topic is being researched by another teammate.</p>
            <h4>Notes</h4>
            <p>
               Discussion forums such as OzBargain, Reddit and Whirlpool were examined.
               It was much easier to search and find data in the text-based discussion forums because the whole community is segmented into niche communities that are more relevant. 
               Finding relevant data on image-based platforms such as Instagram and flickr was much harder because of the sheer amount of posts and weak search options.

            </p>
            <h3 id="part2-1-2">Questionnaires</h3>
            <p>Questionnaires are a cost-effective way to gather short-answer responses from a large amount of people. 
            This was an obvious choice to complement the long-answer responses of the interview and to further leverage the online communities researched for online ethnography. 
            The popularity of these online communities ensured that there would be a decent amount of responses.
            </p>

         <section class="content-container">
            <h1 id="part3">Findings</h1>
            <h3>Online Ethnography</h3>
            <p>Looking through these online communities has shown me that there is so much conflicting information about what can and cannot be recycled. This most likely stems from the fact that different local councils have different specifications on how their residents should deal with their recyclables. A person asking advice on how to recycle their plastics can result in a variety of answers saying different things and they may all be correct for their own area. </p>

            <blockquote>“Check your local council website if unsure, different recycling plants can handle different things. If they don't have the info up can probably give them a call.”</blockquote>

            <p>Recycling methods, as it turns out, seem to be very unique to the individual and is determined by their lifestyle.
            Some people have suggested to donate their paper recycling to animal shelters and others have suggested to trade them on online platforms like gumtree or facebook marketplace.
            </p>

            <blockquote>“...if you have a shredder, shred it up and donate it to pet stores or shelters - they tend to need it for bedding. Or better yet, donate the paper to the places directly.”</blockquote>

            <p>A lot of the suggestions put forward by the members of these online communities tended to lean toward reuse and participating in trash-for-treasure markets or services. This shows that there’s a huge community of people who are willing to buy or trade for a range of second-hand items.</p>

            <blockquote>“Someone's trash can be someone's treasure.”</blockquote>

            <h3>Questionnaires</h3>

            <figure class="image-container">
               <!-- Link your own images from the img folder or somewhere online -->
               <img src="img/whatisage.png" alt="Pie chart visualising age of respondents." />
               <figcaption>Pie chart visualising age of respondents.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Most of the respondants were in the 26-33 age range which makes sense given the platforms that the questionnaire was distributed (Reddit, OzBargain, Whirlpool) which for the most part lean toward a slightly older demographic given their classic discussion boards style of online forum. </p><p>
            Most of the respondents use the council bins to recycle for bottles, paper, cardboard and cans. Compost for food scraps. Return and earn for bottles and cans. Woolworths or Coles to return soft plastics. More niche answers included going to transfer stations to recycle oil, disposing of paper and clothes into an organic worm farm and selling metal to metal recyclers.
            </p><p>
            These answers differ slightly to the time commitment to recycling expressed by the interviewees. While the time spent still lean toward “Not much at all” (see appendix), it’s only a slight skew as almost half have expressed that they spend a decent amount of time to recycling.
            </p><p>
            When questioned about the hardest things about your recycling routine, the respondants expressed frustrations of not knowing what is recyclable and what isn’t. There was also a few opinions on the infrequent e-waste disposal locations. Another significant portion of the respondants expressed the inconvenience of cleaning an item before it’s fit for recycling.</p>

            <blockquote>“Identifying if packaging can be recycled.”
            “E-waste isn't at convenient locations.”
            “Sorting through different types and cleaning them if necessary.”</blockquote>

            <p>When describing their reasoning for recycling, most of the participants responded with reasons about saving the environment mostly from the point of view of preserving resources and limiting the amount of waste they contribute. There is also a large sense of self-responsibility and the sentiment that everybody needs to do their part for the betterment of the environment.</p>

            <blockquote>“There's only one planet!” “To try and do my bit for the environment.”</blockquote>

            <h2 id="part3-1">Interviews</h2>

            <p>7 people were interviewed. All interviewees recycle to some degree and are from different occupations and ages.</p>

            <p> Questions that were asked included:
               <ul>
                  <li>What are you normally recycling?</li>
                  <li>How do you recycle those things?</li>
                  <li>Where did you learn how to recycle?</li>
                  <li>What's the hardest thing about recycling? What makes recycling hard?</li>
                  <li>What makes recycling easy? What's the most enjoyable part of recycling?</li>
                  <li>About how much time are you spending on recycling?</li>
                  <li>Can you tell me about a time when you felt guilty putting something in the trash?</li>
                  <li>Why do you recycle? Is there a memory that stands out to you?</li>
                  <li>Can you tell me of a time when you weren’t too sure about whether or not an object could be recycled?</li>
                  <li>What would it take to get you to recycle more?</li>
                  <li>If you had to find information on how to recycle something how would you go about it?</li>
               </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Because the objective of this research is to find out how people are recycling currently, the questions already assume that the interviewee recycles.</p>

            <p>It was found through these interviews that the most difficult or confusing part about recycling was knowing whether or not something is recyclable. Especially when talking about plastics.</p>

            <p>Another pain point was the convenience of recycling or lack thereof. Some participants noted that it's harder to recycle when they're in an area where there isn't an appropriate bin leaving them to throw away their recyclable rubbish in the general waste.</p>

            <p>When talking about their diligence toward recycling, some participants non-verbally expressed a sense of disappointment in their efforts to recycle. Everybody knows that there's an environmental crisis happening but we sometimes forget or even just ignore it at times.</p>

            <p>The interview data was further analysed through the process of affinity diagramming.</p>

            <h2 id="part3-2">Affinity Diagramming</h2>
            <figure class="image-container">
               <!-- Link your own images from the img folder or somewhere online -->
               <img src="img/affinity/affinitydiagram4.png" alt="Affinity diagram phase 4" />
               <figcaption>Affinity diagram final stage of clustering.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Through creating an affinity diagram with the interview data it was found that there was a large armount of confusion pertaining to how to recycle plastic. It was also found that everyone thought of the act of recycling as very simple for the most part. 
            <br><br>
            These findings reveal a contradiction between the straightforward action of recycling and the complication that the variety of plastics bring. These sentiments align well with the data brought on by the 2018 National Waste Report which found that less than 10% of plastics were recycled in 2016-2017. People are confused about which plastics can be recycled and just throw it in the general waste when in doubt.</p>

                  <h4>Age: 26</h4>
                  <h4>Gender: Female</h4>

            </div>
            <blockquote>“I’ve seen those icons on the bottom of the bottles but does that mean they’re recyclable or that they’re made of recyclable products?”</blockquote>

            <h4>Biography</h4>
            <p>Cody is 26 years old, works full time as a laboratory assistant in IBM. She’s currently living with her parents to save up money to put a deposit down on a house. Everyone in her house shares the housekeeping responsibilities and deals with a decent amount of rubbish. 
</p><p>
About half of the rubbish that she deals with is recycled in various ways. She uses the council recycling bin to dispose of bottles, cans, paper and cardboard. Most of her recyclables consist of packaging from food and shopping. She just recently found out that her local Coles accepts soft plastics and has just started recycling her plastic grocery bags and bubble tea cups. She also repurposes old clothes to make toys for her dog Charlie.
</p><p>
For Cody, recycling is mostly very straightforward. The more complicated aspect of recycling knowing what can and cannot be recycled. While this applies mostly to the many different kinds of plastics (styrofoam, PET, PVC, HDPE, etc), it also applies to things like lightbulbs, soiled pizza boxes and milk cartons. When she’s unsure of where something should go she puts it in the recycling bin and hopes it gets recycled. 
</p><p>
She wishes that she knew exactly what can and cannot be recycled so that she can comfortably know that her rubbish is going to the right place and not unnecessarily adding pollution to the environment. 
</p>
            <h4>Motivations</h4>
            <p>Cody wants to recycle more because she wants to do her part for the planet. She feels a strong sense of responsibility to take care of the environment by reducing her own carbon footprint.
               </p><p>
She also wants to know more about the different kinds of plastic if they can be recycled so that she can be confident that she’s not adding waste to landfill unnecessarily.
</p>
            <h4>Frustrations</h4>
            <p>It can be hard when there are so many different kinds of plastic that complicate the process. </p>
            <p>
She tries to search up information on what can and cannot be recycled but there is conflicting information on the topic.
</p>
            <h4>Ideal experience and Feelings</h4>
            <p>Ideally she would like to be able to tell what items can be recycled so she doesn’t have to spend time researching and sorting through contradictory information. </p>
            <p>She feels confused about the different kinds of plastics and if she can recycle them or not.</p>

            <h1 id="part4">Reflection</h1>
            <p>We had to start over again because I wanted to push for making a game as our final concept at the very start. The couple following weeks was a breeze, we fel tlike we were ahead. Then came the day where we had to think of problem scenarios. This is where we found out that it was not a good idea to start off the design process with a solution in mind. We found ourselves making up a problem for our concept to solve. 

               <p>Our concept was a game that gamified the process of getting a microdegree that would eventually allow people to get a job. We created the problem that there were unhappy people in their current jobs that would like to upskill and get into their dream jobs but couldnt beause they had financial responsibilities. It was impossible to find evidence of this problem existing other than anecdotal. We started from the beginning, starting with problem areas and then narrowing our scope, all with published papers and journal articles to support our decision at every step. Our new problem scenario now is people don’t recycle enough.</p>
</p><p>
As I was going through my transcripts I found that I would sometimes lead the interviewee into answering a certain way. For example in my third interview I asked if there was anything particularly hard like if you get confused about what goes where.
</p><p>
After doing more research and through discussions with my teammates we’ve realised that the scope of our problem scenario may be too narrow in scope. Our scenario “people are not recycling enough” implies that we would rather that people recycle more. However, further research reveals to us that the recycling system in Australia is not effective, as waste from recycling bins go to landfill anyway. Our problem scenario also neglects other ways of dealing with unwanted items such as reusing, selling or donating which are more effective than recycling if the aim is to reduce one’s carbon footprint.
</p><p>
I should’ve asked for someone to help me with the affinity diagramming process to reduce the effect of bias on how the notes were clustered together. I’ve noticed that a lot of my affinity notes were very surface level observations. For example, “I get confused about if certain items are recyclable or not” and “I don't feel guilty for putting a small item that is possible recyclable in the general waste bin”. I feel like I missed an opportunity to delve deeper during the interview.
</p><p>
Some affinity notes were hard to catagorise into user wants (see appendix). This resulted in some notes being excluded. I guess that’s just how things become more refined.
