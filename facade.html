                    A group of nine students from the Bachelor of Design Computing degree at the University of Sydney were invited, on behalf of the 
                    Director of Media Architecture and R&D Center of StrongLED Lighting Systems in Suzhou, to come up with new concepts to showcase
                    their LED and lighting products.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    The brief that we were given described the pervasiveness of personal computing and it's effect on our ability to share the events 
                    of our lives. The ordinary citizen is now a content creator. This rise is in tandem with the rise of large scale urban media that,
                    while still mostly used for advertising, has a potential to be a platform for sharing stories and memories of the urban space.
                </p> -->
                <p>
                    Our design brief challenged us to find ways to use lighting and digital media across different scales to tell local, personal stories 
                    within a large metropolis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After ideating a few concepts and narrowing those down through a few rounds of feedback, our group of four settled on the Fortune Sticks.

                <p>
                    The Fortune Sticks comes from a ancient Chinese tradition of fortune telling where a person will shake a wooden cylinder filled with 
                    numbered sticks until one fell out. The person must then take that number and refer a book containing their fortune.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be fun to have a person from the top of a building scan a QR code that connects their phone to the buildings facade and then
                    have them shake their phone to get their fortune. Their stick will fall down the building and onto the street level where an 
                    animation will play out their fortune.

                <p>
                    My primary role for this project was to code animations and interactions inbetween the idle and fortune animations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the main project was completed, I coded a smaller project to be displayed in a smaller room for the exhibition.

                <p>
                    This project has taught me the value of simplicity. In hindsight, the concept
                    may have been too complex for a 10-day development schedule (minus 4-5 days
                    for ideation and weekends). While the different animation phases - idle, falling
                    stick, reveal, fortune animation – were fine to code, the hidden workload was
                    coding the transitions between those phases. There were physical requirements
                    for our concept that could not have been provided for the exhibition, but if it were
                    simpler, the whole experience may have been smoother and more coherent for the
                    user.
