               David couldn’t wait to start the next chapter of his life at university.
               At 18 years old, he is a first year engineering student who just graduated
               high school. <br>
               Before the start of the semester, he attended O-week to meet his fellow classmates and investigate
               what buildings he would be regularly visiting. He was excited but overwhelmed by the size of the
               campus.<br>
               He was confident that he would be able to easily identify the buildings but come the start of the
               semester, David still needed a reference for navigation. He used the USYD app but found that it only
               had information on the more popular buildings and wished it had more information on his less
               commonly known buildings.<br>
               He ended up using Google Maps in the first couple of weeks of the semester to find the buildings
               where his classes are held. Finding the building was only half the struggle, he had to look high and
               low for his room. Room 281, room 281, or was it room 182? I think I remember it being 182. In the
               midst of the class-finding scramble David had forgotten his room number and whipped out his phone
               to refer to his timetable.<br>
               There was no internet connection and he hadn’t saved his schedule for offline use. Things weren’t
               looking too good for his first week of semester. He eventually asked another student if they knew
               where his class was and luckily she was making her way to the very same class and led him to the
               correct room number.

               Alice is in her second year of study at USYD working toward a science
               degree. She’s also more familiar with university life and is hoping she
               can focus more on her studies this year.<br>
               Her classes this semester are quite spread throughout the campus and only has
               difficulty with the lesser-known buildings. She finds that the apps currently available do
               not have much information on them.<br>
               “The problem is that they’re very user generated which means that the popular buildings
               have all the information on how to get there and what to look for but the more obscure
               buildings have almost nothing on them.”<br>
               She has learned to accept the partial functionality of these apps and only uses them to
               locate the general area of where the building is located.<br>
               “Then I just look for signs around the area and landmarks around the area. Not the best
               way but it works!”<br>
               In her spare time Alice loves to explore the campus to find less populated places to
               study and just less populated places in general. She used to go to Fisher Library to study
               but found that the students there often talk and eat. She’s found rooms in buildings not
               commonly visited and enjoys having a quiet place to study or relax during her breaks.
