                    <h1>StrongLED Exhibition</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was part of a group that was invited by StrongLED - the leading Chinese manufacturer of LEDs and media facades - to produce a concept for possible development. Our goal was to find ways to tell local and personal stories within a
                        large city across multiple scales through lighting and digital media.

                    <h1>Visibility Tile Flip</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>A large-scale interactive display that facilitates collaboration. The aim of the project was to raise awareness through allowing people to experience how different visual impairments affect the perception of everyday objects.</p>

                    <h1>Interactive Poem</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>The interactive poem is my idea to engage with short-form texts. The aim is to have users reflect on the composition of a poem as they combine words together. The minimalist graphics provides as much space as possible for the words
                        as the user constructs the poem.

                    <h1>Animated Jigsaw Puzzle</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>I thought it would be interesting to make a jigsaw puzzle with animated pieces instead of a static images.</p>
