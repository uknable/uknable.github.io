                    <h1>StrongLED Exhibition</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was part of a group that was invited by StrongLED - the leading Chinese manufacturer of LEDs and media facades - to produce a concept for possible development. Our goal was to find ways to tell local and personal stories within a
                        large city across multiple scales through lighting and digital media.

                    <h1>Visibility Tile Flip</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>A large-scale interactive display that facilitates collaboration. The aim of the project was to raise awareness through allowing people to experience how different visual impairments affect the perception of everyday objects.</p>

                    <h1>Interactive Poem</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>The interactive poem is an new way to engage with short-form texts. The aim of this concept was to have users reflect on the composition of sentences. The minimalist graphics provides as much space as possible as the user constructs
                        the poem.</p>

                    <h1>Animated Jigsaw Puzzle</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>I thought it would be interesting to have people solve a jigsaw puzzle with animated pieces instead of a static image.</p>
