                I'm a UI/UX designer that used to be a chef but wants to keep serving up delightful experiences. 
                I get fired up when working on something that will have a positive impact on the user and eventually their community.

                    In collaboration with the Childrenâ€™s Hospital and Westmead Clinical School, we designed and developed an interactive online module to help medical students learn how to diagnose congenital heart deformities in babies.

                <h1>StrongLED Exhibition</h1>
                <p>I was part of a group that was invited by StrongLED - the leading Chinese manufacturer of LEDs and media facades - to produce a concept for possible development. Our goal was to find ways to tell local and personal stories within a
                    large city across multiple scales through lighting and digital media. Our concepts were then exhibited at StrongLED in Suzhou, China.

                <h1>Interactive Poem</h1>
                <p>The interactive poem is my idea to engage with short-form texts. The aim is to have users reflect on the composition of a poem as they combine words together. The minimalist graphics provides as much space as possible for the words
                    as the user constructs the poem.
